PyMetaWatch by Travis Goodspeed

This is a hastily written library for communicating with Fossil's
MetaWatch over Bluetooth through py-bluez in Linux or Maemo.  Use
an address of "none" to scan.  If no image is specified, the client
should at least set the time.

You are welcome to fork this in any way, under any license, for any
reason, so long as a appropriate attribution is kept.


Usage:
python pymw.py $btaddr $image
