PyMetaWatch by Travis Goodspeed

This is a hastily written library for communicating with Fossil's
MetaWatch over Bluetooth through py-bluez in Linux or Maemo.  Use
an address of "none" to scan.  If no image is specified, the client
should at least set the time.

Feel free to fork, rewrite, or fix this is in any way.  Leave whatever
attribution is appropriate intact.


Usage:
python pymw.py $btaddr $image
